# Channel: Ad Copy

**Format:** Headline + description + CTA

**Typical length:** Headline 5-15 words, description 15-40 words

**Use for:** Google Ads, Facebook/Meta ads, LinkedIn ads, display ads, retargeting

---

## Audience Temperature

**Cold to cool. Interruptive. Paid placement.**

The reader:
- Wasn't looking for you (or was searching related terms)
- Sees your ad among many others
- Will glance for 1 second max
- Needs a reason to click instead of scroll

You paid for this impression. Make it count.

---

## Reading Behavior

**Glance. 1 second.**

- Headline must work completely alone
- Description is a bonus — many won't read it
- Visual (if applicable) carries weight too
- Users are ad-blind — you need to break pattern

**Implications:**
- Headline is 90% of the work
- Every word must earn its place
- Specificity beats cleverness
- Clear > creative

## Format Constraints

### Structure
```
**Headline:** [5-15 words — does all the heavy lifting]
**Description:** [15-40 words — supports headline, includes CTA]
```

### Platform-Specific Limits

**Google Search Ads:**
- Headlines: Up to 3, each 30 characters max
- Descriptions: Up to 2, each 90 characters max

**Facebook/Meta Ads:**
- Primary text: 125 characters before truncation
- Headline: 40 characters recommended
- Description: 30 characters recommended

**LinkedIn Ads:**
- Headline: 70 characters max
- Intro text: 150 characters before truncation
- Description: 70 characters max

### General Guidelines
- Headline: 5-15 words / 30-70 characters
- Description: 15-40 words / 60-120 characters
- Total: Extremely compressed

## Proof Types That Work

In ads, proof must be instant:
- **One specific number:** "2,400+ users" or "34% conversion lift"
- **One credibility signal:** "As seen in [publication]"
- **Social proof shorthand:** "Join 10,000 founders"

**What doesn't work:**
- Testimonials (no room)
- Multiple proof points (pick the strongest)
- Anything that requires context

**Often, no proof fits.** The ad earns the click. The landing page delivers proof.

---

## CTA Rules

**One CTA, baked into description or as final words.**

**CTA must be:**
- Action verb: "Try," "Get," "See," "Start"
- Outcome-oriented: What they get, not what they do
- Low friction: Don't ask for too much

**Good ad CTAs:**
- "Try it free"
- "See it in action"
- "Get your rewrite"
- "Start in 30 seconds"

**Bad ad CTAs:**
- "Learn more" (too vague)
- "Click here" (obvious)
- "Sign up for our newsletter" (too much ask)

---

## Core Promise Inheritance

The headline carries the ENTIRE core promise. There is no room for setup, build, or explanation. The headline IS the ad.

**The headline must:**
- State the outcome clearly, OR
- Name the reader's problem, OR
- Make a claim that demands attention

**Competitor test (stricter than landing page):** If this headline could be any product in the category, it's too generic. Specificity is everything.

---

## Framework Beat → Ad Mapping

The entire framework compresses to 2-3 lines:
1. One line capturing Problem or Before or Attention or Promise
2. One line capturing Solution or After or Outcome
3. One action

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Google Search Ads
- User is searching — they have intent
- Match headline to search intent
- Include keywords naturally
- Multiple headlines = test variations

### Facebook/Meta Ads
- Interruptive — user wasn't searching
- Visual does heavy lifting
- Primary text can be slightly longer
- Hook must stop the scroll

### LinkedIn Ads
- Professional context
- Decision-makers, B2B audiences
- Credibility signals matter more
- Adjust tone to be more direct

### Retargeting Ads
- Warmer audience — they've seen your site
- Can be more specific
- "Still thinking about it?" angle works
- Remind them of value they've already seen

## Output Template

```
**Headline:** [5-15 words — the entire ad lives here]

**Headline 2:** [Secondary angle or proof]

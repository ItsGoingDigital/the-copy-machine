# Channel: Email

**Format:** Single column, flowing text

**Typical length:** 150–400 words

**Use for:** Product announcements, nurture sequences, newsletters, promotional emails

---

## Audience Temperature

**Opted-in.** The reader:
- Gave you permission to email them
- Has some existing relationship with the brand
- Is warmer than a landing page visitor

But attention is fragmented. Inbox is crowded. They're scanning, not reading.

---

## Reading Behavior

**Scan from top. Decide fast.**

- Preview text (first ~90 characters) determines open-to-read
- Subject line determines open
- First sentence must hook — most readers decide in 3 seconds
- They'll scan the first few lines, then decide to keep reading or not
- No one reads emails word-by-word on first pass

**Implications:**
- Subject line = headline (most important element)
- Preview text = subhead (second most important)
- First sentence must hook immediately
- Short paragraphs, scannable format
- Get to the point fast

---

## Format Constraints

### Structure
- **Subject line:** 5-10 words. Clear > clever.
- **Preview text:** First ~90 characters of the email. Treat as second headline.
- **Body:** Flows as one piece. No headers or section labels.
- **CTA:** Link text, not button.
- **Sign-off:** Optional, depends on brand voice.

### Length Limits
- Total: 150-400 words
- Paragraphs: 1-3 sentences max
- Sentences: Keep short. Mobile readers.

### No Headers
Unlike landing pages, emails don't have section headers. Framework beats happen in paragraphs, not labeled sections. The email reads as one continuous piece.

## Proof Types That Work

Proof must be quick and inline:
- **Quick mentions:** "10,000 people have used this"
- **One strong stat:** "Average conversion lift: 34%"
- **Brief social proof:** "Featured in [publication]"
- **Short testimonial:** One sentence, inline

**What doesn't work:**
- Long testimonial blocks
- Screenshots or visual proof (text-based channel)
- Multiple proof points (pick the strongest one)

---

## CTA Rules

**One CTA. Max two placements:**
1. Mid-email (after core pitch)
2. End of email

**CTA format:**
- Link text, not button
- Specific: "See the before and after" not "Learn more"
- Describes what they'll see/get, not just the action

**Bad CTAs:**
- "Click here"
- "Learn more"
- "Check it out"

**Good CTAs:**
- "See what your rewrite looks like"
- "Try the 30-second demo"
- "Read the full case study"

---

## Core Promise Inheritance

The subject line carries the core promise from the framework. The email body supports and expands this promise. Everything serves getting the click.

**Subject line must:**
- Create curiosity, OR
- Make a specific promise, OR
- Name something the reader recognizes

**Never:**
- Clickbait that the email doesn't deliver on
- ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation!!!
- Generic "Check this out"

## Framework Beat → Paragraph Mapping

### PAS (Feel the Pain)
| Beat | Email Section |
|------|---------------|
| Problem | First 1-2 paragraphs |
| Agitate | Paragraph 3 |
| Solution | Final paragraphs + CTA |

### BAB (Transformation)
| Beat | Email Section |
|------|---------------|
| Before | Opening paragraph(s) |
| After | Middle paragraph(s) |
| Bridge | Final paragraph + CTA |

### AIDA (Build Urgency)
| Beat | Email Section |
|------|---------------|
| Attention | Subject line + first sentence |
| Interest | Paragraph 2 |
| Desire | Paragraphs 3-4 |
| Action | Final paragraph + CTA |

### FAB (Lead with Value)
| Beat | Email Section |
|------|---------------|
| Outcome | First paragraph |
| Mechanism | Brief middle paragraph |
| Proof | One strong proof point |

### 4Ps (Dream Then Prove)
| Beat | Email Section |
|------|---------------|
| Promise | Subject + first sentence |
| Picture | Paragraph 2 |
| Proof | Quick social proof or stat |
| Push | Final paragraph + CTA |

---

## Compression Rules

Email compresses everything. Framework beats that get full sections on a landing page become single paragraphs in email.

**Compression guidelines:**
- Problem: 1-2 sentences, not paragraphs
- Agitate: 1 sentence escalation, not a full section
- Proof: One stat or testimonial, not multiple
- CTA: One action, clear and immediate

---

## Output Template

```
**Subject:** [5-10 words — clear promise or curiosity]
**Preview:** [First ~90 characters — expands subject, creates open-to-read]

[Opening paragraph — hook immediately, maps to first framework beat]

[Middle paragraphs — framework beats 2-3, compressed]

[Proof paragraph — one strong proof point]

[CTA link text]

[Optional: Final line with CTA repeated]

[Optional: Sign-off if brand voice warrants]
```

# Channel: Landing Page

**Format:** Scroll-based, multi-section page

**Typical length:** 500–1500 words

**Use for:** Product launches, feature pages, tool pages, homepage hero sections

---

## Audience Temperature

**Warm.** The reader arrived intentionally. They:
- Clicked a link from somewhere (ad, social, email, referral)
- Searched for something related
- Were recommended by someone

They're not cold — they have context. But they're not ready to buy yet. The page needs to confirm their interest and move them toward action.

---

## Reading Behavior

**Scroll and scan.**

- Headlines and subheads get read first
- Body copy only gets read if the headline earned it
- Assume 60% of visitors never scroll past the hero
- Readers make judgments in 3-5 seconds
- Visual hierarchy matters — important content needs prominence

**Implications:**
- Hero headline is the single most important element
- Every section must earn the scroll to the next
- Subheads should tell the story alone (skimmable)
- Don't bury key information in body paragraphs

---

## Format Constraints

### Section Structure
- Hero section (headline + subhead + primary CTA)
- 3-6 additional sections depending on framework
- Each section maps to a framework beat
- Clear visual separation between sections

### Hero Section Requirements
- **Headline:** 5-15 words. The single most important element.
- **Subhead:** 1-2 sentences. Expands the headline.
- **CTA:** Visible above the fold. Specific text.
- **No more than one primary action in the hero**

### Section Length
- Sections: 50-200 words each
- Paragraphs: 2-4 sentences max
- White space is content — use it

---

## Proof Types That Work

All proof types work on landing pages:
- **Testimonials:** Full quotes with names and context
- **Stats/data:** Specific numbers, not vague claims
- **Before/after:** Screenshots, comparisons
- **Logos:** If you have recognizable customers
- **Case studies:** Summary versions, link to full
- **Demos/screenshots:** Show the product
- **Social proof numbers:** "10,000 users" etc.

**Placement:** Proof typically comes after the core value proposition is established. After the "After" beat, after the "Solution" beat, etc.

---

## CTA Rules

**Minimum 2 CTAs:**
1. One in the hero (above the fold)
2. One at the bottom

**Optional additional CTAs:**
- Mid-page after the After/Solution beat
- After proof section

**CTA text rules:**
- Specific, not generic: "Fix My Copy — $49" not "Get Started"
- Restate the benefit when possible: "Get Your Rewrite" not "Submit"
- Same CTA text throughout (consistency)
- Action verb + outcome

**Button vs link:**
- Primary CTA = button
- Secondary CTA = link

---

## Core Promise Inheritance

The core promise from the framework must appear in the hero headline. This promise carries through the entire page. Every section supports or proves this core promise.

**The headline must:**
- Name the reader's specific situation, OR
- Make a claim only this product can make, OR
- State a specific, surprising outcome

**Competitor test:** Could this headline appear unchanged on a competitor's site? If yes, it's too generic.

## Section That DON'T Belong

Cut these unless they directly serve a framework beat:
- "About Us" (unless proof-oriented)
- Team bios
- Company history
- Generic feature grids
- "Why choose us" lists that could apply to any competitor
- Mission statements (unless warm-mission-driven tone)

Every section must serve a beat. If it doesn't, cut it.

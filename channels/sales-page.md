# Channel: Sales Page

**Format:** Long-form, scroll-based, multi-section

**Typical length:** 1500–4000 words

**Use for:** High-ticket products, complex products, products that need extensive proof, courses, consulting, SaaS with significant commitment

---

## Audience Temperature

**Warm to hot.**

The reader:
- Clicked through from somewhere else (ad, email, referral)
- Is actively considering buying
- Has time to read if you earn it
- Needs comprehensive proof before committing

They're close to a decision. Your job: remove all remaining objections.

---

## Reading Behavior

**Long scroll, but skimmable.**

- Readers will scroll the full page (if interested)
- But they'll skim first — subheads, proof elements, price
- Subheads function as a standalone story
- Many readers jump to price first, then back up to justify it
- A reader who only reads subheads should understand the pitch

**Implications:**
- Every subhead must carry weight
- Proof must be substantial and visible
- Objection handling is critical
- FAQs aren't optional — they're load-bearing

---

## Format Constraints

### Section Structure
- Hero section (headline + subhead + promise)
- 6-12 additional sections
- Each section maps to a framework beat OR supports one
- FAQ/objection section is required
- Guarantee section (if applicable)
- Multiple CTAs throughout

### Hero Section
- **Headline:** Bold promise or problem statement
- **Subhead:** Expands the promise
- **Supporting copy:** 1-2 paragraphs that set up the page
- **Primary CTA:** Optional in hero (some sales pages delay)

### Section Length
- Sections: 100-400 words each
- Some sections can be longer (proof, mechanism)
- Use subheads within long sections
- White space between sections

### Required Sections
1. Hero (promise/problem)
2. Framework beats (expanded)
3. Mechanism/how it works
4. Proof section(s) — testimonials, case studies, data
5. FAQ/objection handling
6. Final CTA section

### Optional Sections
- Guarantee/risk reversal
- Who this is for / not for
- Comparison to alternatives
- Pricing breakdown
- Bonus section (if applicable)

---

## Proof Types That Work

**Everything. And more of it.**

Sales pages need comprehensive proof:
- **Multiple testimonials:** Full quotes with names, photos, context
- **Case studies:** Detailed before/after stories
- **Data/stats:** Specific numbers, charts if helpful
- **Before/after comparisons:** Visual or text-based
- **Screenshots/demos:** Show the product working
- **Logos:** Recognizable customers
- **Media mentions:** "As featured in..."
- **Guarantee:** Risk reversal that reduces barrier

**Proof placement:**
- After the main value proposition
- After the "how it works" section
- Before the FAQ (helps answer objections)
- Integrated throughout (not just one section)

---

## CTA Rules

**3+ CTAs throughout the page.**

**Placement:**
1. After the After/Solution beat
2. After proof section
3. After FAQ/objections
4. Final section (primary CTA)

**Repetition is expected.** The reader might be ready at different points. Give them the opportunity.

**CTA rules:**
- Same text throughout (or minor variations)
- Specific: "Get The Copy Machine — $49" not "Get Started"
- Include price if possible
- Consider adding guarantee reminder near CTA

---

## Core Promise Inheritance

The hero headline establishes the promise. Every section of the sales page either expands, proves, or reinforces this promise.

**The promise should be:**
- Bold enough to justify long-form content
- Specific enough to be believable
- Valuable enough to justify the price

**Through-line:** A reader should never wonder "wait, what is this page selling?" The promise recurs throughout.

## Framework Beat → Section Mapping

Sales pages expand every beat. What's one section on a landing page becomes multiple sections here.

### PAS (Feel the Pain)
| Beat | Sales Page Sections |
|------|---------------------|
| Problem | Hero + Section 2 (multiple problem angles) |
| Agitate | Section 3 (what happens if unsolved) + case study of pain |
| Solution | Sections 4-6 (mechanism, features, proof) |
| + | FAQ, Guarantee, Final CTA |

### BAB (Transformation)
| Beat | Sales Page Sections |
|------|---------------------|
| Before | Hero + Sections 2-3 (multiple scenarios, recognition) |
| After | Sections 4-5 (vivid visualization, specific outcomes) |
| Bridge | Sections 6-8 (mechanism, features, how to get started) |
| + | Proof sections, FAQ, Guarantee, Final CTA |

### AIDA (Build Urgency)

## Required: FAQ/Objection Section

**This is not optional on sales pages.**

The FAQ section handles objections that would otherwise prevent purchase. Common objections:
- "Is this right for me?"
- "What if it doesn't work?"
- "How is this different from [alternative]?"
- "How long until I see results?"
- "What do I actually get?"
- "Is there a guarantee?"

**Format:**
```
## Frequently Asked Questions

**[Question phrased as reader would ask it]**
[Direct answer — don't be evasive]

**[Question 2]**
[Answer]

[Continue for 5-10 questions]
```

**Tone in FAQ:** Direct, honest, specific. The FAQ is a trust-builder. Evasive answers destroy trust.

---

## Guarantee/Risk Reversal Section

If applicable, include a guarantee section. This reduces perceived risk and can increase conversion.

**Elements:**
- What the guarantee covers
- How long it lasts
- What the reader has to do to claim it
- What happens when they claim it

**Tone:** Confident. You believe in the product.

---

## Subhead Requirements

**Subheads must tell the story alone.**

Test: Read ONLY the subheads in order. Does the page make sense? Does the pitch come through?

**Good subhead sequence:**
1. "Your landing page sounds like everyone else's"
2. "Here's what that costs you"
3. "There's a faster way"
4. "How it works"
5. "What people are saying"
6. "Common questions"
7. "Ready to fix your copy?"

**Bad subheads:** "Introduction," "Features," "Testimonials," "Conclusion"

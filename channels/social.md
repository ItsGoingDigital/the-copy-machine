# Channel: Social Post

**Format:** Hook + body + CTA

**Typical length:** 50–280 characters for hook, up to 500 characters total

**Use for:** Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram captions, Threads

---

## Audience Temperature

**Cold. Interruptive.**

The reader:
- Wasn't looking for you
- Is mid-scroll through other content
- Has 1-2 seconds to decide if this is worth stopping for
- Has no context about your product

You're interrupting. Earn the stop.

---

## Reading Behavior

**1-2 seconds to earn attention.**

- Hook line is everything
- If the first line doesn't stop the scroll, nothing else matters
- Most readers won't expand to read the full post
- Visual/formatting pattern interrupts can help (but don't abuse)

**Implications:**
- The hook IS the copy. Everything else is bonus.
- Get the core message into the first line
- Body is for people who already stopped — don't waste their time
- CTA must feel natural, not salesy

## Format Constraints

### Structure
```
[Hook line — stops the scroll]

[Body — 1-3 sentences, expands the hook]

[CTA — question or invitation]

[Hashtags if platform-appropriate]
```

### Character Limits (Approximate)
- **Hook:** 50-280 characters (depends on platform)
- **Body:** 1-3 sentences
- **Total post:** Up to 500 characters recommended
- **Twitter/X:** 280 character limit for full post
- **LinkedIn:** Can be longer but front-load value
- **Instagram:** Caption can be long but first line matters most

### Line Breaks
- Use line breaks liberally
- One idea per line
- White space helps scanability

---

## Proof Types That Work

Only the briefest proof works in social:
- **One specific number:** "12,000 people use this"
- **One surprising stat:** "34% average conversion lift"
- **Brief credibility:** "Featured in [publication]"

**What doesn't work:**
- Testimonials (too long)
- Multiple proof points (pick one)
- Case studies (save for landing page)

---

## CTA Rules

**One CTA. End of post.**

**CTA format:**
- Question: "Curious?" → link
- Invitation: "Try it free" → link
- Natural extension: "Link in bio" / "Link below"

**CTA must feel natural.** Aggressive "BUY NOW" energy doesn't work on social. Invitation > demand.

**Good CTAs:**
- "Worth 30 seconds to try?"
- "Link if you want to see what it does"
- "Try it yourself → [link]"

**Bad CTAs:**
- "Sign up now!"
- "Don't miss out!"
- "Click the link to get started"

---

## Core Promise Inheritance

The hook line carries the entire framework's promise. Social doesn't have room for full frameworks — you get ONE beat, maybe two.

**The hook must:**
- State the Problem memorably, OR
- Capture the Before in a line, OR
- Make the Promise in a sentence

**The body can:**
- Add one supporting point
- Tease the mechanism
- Include a quick proof point

---

## Framework Beat → Social Mapping

Social compresses everything. Only the strongest beat from each framework survives.

### PAS (Feel the Pain)
**Hook = Problem stated memorably**
> "Your landing page sounds like every other landing page. Same AI copy, same 2% conversion rate."

Body = Hint at solution. CTA = Link.

### BAB (Transformation)
**Hook = Before + After compressed**
> "Before: generic AI copy. After: copy that sounds like you but sharper. (30 seconds to switch.)"

### AIDA (Build Urgency)
**Hook = Attention (the pattern interrupt)**
> "73% of landing pages have the same headline structure. Yours probably does too."

Body = Quick Interest. CTA = Desire implied + link.

### FAB (Lead with Value)
**Hook = Outcome stated plainly**
> "Landing page copy that converts. 30 seconds. $49."

Body = Brief mechanism. CTA = Link.

### 4Ps (Dream Then Prove)
**Hook = Promise**
> "Copy that converts — written in 60 seconds, not 6 hours."

Body = One proof point. CTA = Link.

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Twitter/X
- 280 character max
- Hook must work alone (many won't expand)
- Thread format can expand for more content
- Links may reduce engagement — sometimes better to hook first, link in reply

### LinkedIn
- Longer posts acceptable but front-load value
- First 2-3 lines show before "see more"
- Professional context — adjust tone accordingly
- Links often better in first comment

### Instagram
- Caption length flexible but first line is everything
- Emojis more accepted (if brand-appropriate)
- CTA often "link in bio"
- Visual must match caption

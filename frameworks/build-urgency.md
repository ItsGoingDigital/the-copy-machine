# Framework: Build Urgency (AIDA)

**Structure:** Attention → Interest → Desire → Action

**Use when:** The reader doesn't know they have a problem yet, or isn't actively looking for a solution. You need to interrupt their scroll, earn their attention, warm them up, and move them to action step by step.

---

## Awareness Level

**Unaware to problem-aware.** The reader isn't looking for you. They're scrolling, distracted, doing something else. You need to stop them with something surprising or relevant, then guide them through understanding why this matters before you can ask for action.

---

## Required Beats

### Beat 1: Attention

**Purpose:** A hook that stops the scroll. Pattern interrupt.

**Rules:**
- Surprising stat, provocative question, bold claim, or unexpected angle.
- Must be relevant — clickbait that doesn't connect to the product fails.
- No product yet. This is pure hook.
- Should work as a standalone line — if they only read this, they should be curious.
- Test: would you stop scrolling if you saw this?

**Good example:** "73% of landing pages have the same headline structure. Yours probably does too."

**Good example:** "What if the AI writing your copy was trained on other AI copy?"

**Bad example:** "Welcome to our product page!"

**Bad example:** "Are you looking for better marketing?" (too generic)

**Length:** 1-2 sentences. This is the sharpest beat. No wandering.

### Beat 2: Interest

**Purpose:** Context and detail. Expand on the hook. Explain why this matters.

**Rules:**
- Build on the Attention hook — don't abandon it.
- Provide context: what does this mean? Why should they care?
- Start introducing the problem or opportunity.
- Still warming up — not selling yet.
- Educate without lecturing.

**Good example:** "Here's why that matters: when everyone's copy sounds the same, conversion rates flatline. Visitors can't tell you apart from the three other tabs they have open. Your product might be better — but your words aren't proving it."

**Bad example:** "Our product is the best solution for this problem." (too early)

**Logical register:** This is where it starts. Context, explanation, why it matters.

**Length:** 1-3 paragraphs. Enough to establish stakes.

### Beat 3: Desire

**Purpose:** Make it personal. What this means for the reader specifically.

**Rules:**
- Shift from "this is interesting" to "I want this."
- Connect to the reader's specific situation, identity, or goals.
- Show what's possible for them — not abstractly, but for them.
- Introduce the product here, positioned as the answer to what they now want.
- Create want, not just understanding.

**Good example:** "Imagine your next landing page converts at 2x your current rate — not because you learned copywriting, but because you used the same frameworks the copywriters use. Two questions, thirty seconds, and your page sounds like you hired someone who charges $5,000."

**Emotional register:** This is the peak. Aspiration, want, identity, possibility.

**Length:** 2-4 paragraphs. This is often the longest beat — you're building want.

### Beat 4: Action

**Purpose:** The CTA. Clear, specific, low-friction.

**Rules:**
- Direct ask. No hedging, no "maybe consider."
- Specific action: what exactly do they do?
- Low friction: make it feel easy.
- Restate the benefit in the CTA if possible.
- Don't introduce new information — just the ask.

**Good example:** "Try The Copy Machine free. Pick your vibe, pick your goal, and get your first rewrite in under a minute."

**Bad example:** "Get started" (too vague)

**Bad example:** "Sign up for our newsletter to learn more" (wrong ask)

**Length:** 1-2 sentences + button/link text.

## Transition Rules

### Attention → Interest

**Transition type:** Curiosity / "Here's why"

**Phrases that work:**
- "Here's why that matters:"
- "Let me explain."
- "That number isn't random."
- "Here's what's behind that:"

**Mechanism:** The hook raised a question or made a claim. Now answer it or support it.

### Interest → Desire

**Transition type:** Personalization / "For you"

**Phrases that work:**
- "Here's what that means for you:"
- "And here's the opportunity:"
- "If you're [reader identity], this changes everything."
- "Imagine what happens when..."

**Mechanism:** They understand the context. Now make it about them.

### Desire → Action

**Transition type:** Momentum / "So here's the move"

**Phrases that work:**
- "So here's the move:"
- "Ready to try it?"
- "Here's how to start:"
- "One click and you're in."

**Mechanism:** They want it. Remove all friction between want and action.

---

## Section Count

**4-5 sections total.**

This is the longest framework. Each beat builds on the last — you cannot skip steps.

**Core structure:**
1. Attention (hero/hook)
2. Interest (context section)
3. Desire (often 2 sections — the vision + the product)
4. Action (CTA section)

**You cannot:**
- Skip from Attention to Action (no earned desire)
- Skip Interest (desire won't land without context)
- Rush Desire (this is where conviction builds)

## Channel Compression Guide

### Landing Page
Full 4-beat structure. Attention = hero. Interest = section 2. Desire = sections 3-4. Action = final section + CTAs throughout.

### Email
Attention = subject line + first sentence. Interest = paragraph 2. Desire = paragraph 3-4. Action = final paragraph + link.

### Social
Attention = hook line (must be perfect). Interest + Desire compressed to 1-2 sentences. Action = CTA.

### Ad Copy
Attention = headline. Interest + Desire = description (compressed). Action = CTA baked in.

### Sales Page
All beats expanded. Attention can be multi-part hook. Interest can be full education section. Desire expands to features, visualization, testimonials. Action repeated multiple times with FAQ/objection handling before final CTA.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Weak Attention hook.** If the hook is generic ("Want better results?"), nothing else matters.
- **Abandoning the hook.** Interest must connect back to what got their Attention.
- **Interest without stakes.** Context alone isn't enough — they need to care.
- **Desire that's abstract.** "Better results" isn't desire. Specific outcomes for them = desire.
- **Skipping beats.** Every beat is required. This framework doesn't compress to 2 sections.
- **Soft Action.** "Learn more" is not a CTA. Specific action, specific benefit.
- **Manufactured urgency.** Don't fake scarcity or deadlines. The urgency should come from the desire you built.

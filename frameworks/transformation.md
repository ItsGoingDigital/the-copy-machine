# Framework: Transformation (BAB)

**Structure:** Before → After → Bridge

**Use when:** You want to sell the change, not the product. The reader knows their current situation isn't ideal, and they're drawn to a better future. Show them what's possible, then show them how to get there.

---

## Awareness Level

**Problem-aware to solution-aware.** The reader knows something's off. They may have tried other solutions. They're ready to hear about a better way — but they need to see the destination before they'll care about the vehicle.

---

## Required Beats

### Beat 1: Before

**Purpose:** The reader's current frustrating reality. Describe their situation back to them.

**Rules:**
- Specificity is everything. Generic "before" states don't resonate.
- Use their language, their daily experience, their internal monologue.
- The goal is recognition: "That's exactly me."
- No product yet. This is entirely about where they are now.
- Include sensory details if possible — what does this reality look like, feel like?

**Good example:** "Right now, you're staring at a blank page. Or worse — a page full of AI-generated copy that sounds like it could be for any product in your category. You've tried prompting it differently. You've tried different AI tools. Same result: generic, forgettable, converts like everything else."

**Bad example:** "Many people struggle to write effective copy."

**Emotional register:** Frustration, stuckness, resignation. They've accepted this as normal.

**Length:** 1-3 paragraphs depending on channel. Can expand into multiple scenarios.

### Beat 2: After

**Purpose:** What life looks like once the problem is solved. NOT the product — the outcome.

**Rules:**
- Show the change. What's different? What's better?
- Be specific about the transformation. Not "better copy" but what better copy gets them.
- Paint the scene — what does their day/work/life look like on the other side?
- Still no product mechanics. This is about the destination, not the vehicle.
- Make it feel achievable, not fantastical.

**Good example:** "Now imagine: your landing page loads, and the headline makes visitors stop. Not because it's clever — because it's specific. It speaks directly to what they're struggling with. They scroll. They read. They click. Your conversion rate isn't a mystery anymore — it's a metric you actually trust."

**Bad example:** "With our product, everything is better!"

**Emotional register:** Hope, possibility, relief. The weight lifts.

**Length:** 1-3 paragraphs. Match the length of Before — the contrast should feel balanced.

### Beat 3: Bridge

**Purpose:** How you get from Before to After. The product enters here as the mechanism.

**Rules:**
- Direct connection: "Here's how you get there."
- Introduce the product as the bridge, not the destination.
- Keep it tight — 3 steps max, simple explanation.
- Include enough mechanism that it feels real, not magical.
- Transition to proof or CTA.

**Good example:** "The Copy Machine gets you there in three steps: pick a vibe, pick what your copy should do, answer two questions about your product. That's it. The framework, tone, and format are handled — you get copy that sounds like you, structured to convert."

**Bad example:** "Our revolutionary platform leverages cutting-edge AI to transform your copy."

**Logical register:** This is where it lives. How it works, what you do, the mechanism.

**Length:** 1-2 paragraphs for the core explanation. Can expand to features/proof in longer formats.

## Transition Rules

### Before → After

**Transition type:** Natural consequence / Imagination

**Phrases that work:**
- "Now imagine instead."
- "But it doesn't have to be this way."
- "What if, instead..."
- "Picture this:"
- "Here's what's possible:"

**Mechanism:** You've established where they are. Now show them where they could be. The transition should feel like lifting a weight.

### After → Bridge

**Transition type:** "Here's how"

**Phrases that work:**
- "Here's how you get there."
- "The bridge between where you are and where you want to be is..."
- "Getting there is simpler than you think."
- "That transformation? Here's what makes it happen."

**Mechanism:** They're sold on the destination. Now show them the path is walkable.

---

## Section Count

**3-5 sections total.**

Core structure:
1. Before (can be 1-2 sections if exploring multiple angles)
2. After (can expand to include specifics of what changes)
3. Bridge (tight — the mechanism, 3 steps max)

**Optional additions:**
- Proof section after Bridge (testimonials from people who made the transformation)
- Specifics section within After (what exactly changes)

**This framework does NOT need:**
- Feature dumps
- Long "how it works" technical sections
- Multiple CTA sections
- About/team content

## Channel Compression Guide

### Landing Page
Before = Hero + first section. After = Section 2. Bridge = Section 3. Proof optional as Section 4.

### Email
Before = opening paragraph(s). After = middle paragraph(s). Bridge = final paragraph + CTA. Flows as one piece.

### Social
Before + After compressed to 2 sentences. Bridge = implied by CTA. "You're [Before]. You could be [After]. [Product] is the bridge. [Link]"

### Ad Copy
Headline = Before (stated as recognition) or After (stated as promise). Description = Bridge compressed + CTA.

### Sales Page
All beats expanded significantly. Before can be an entire section with multiple scenarios. After gets full visualization. Bridge expands to mechanism + features + proof + FAQ.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Starting with the product.** Before comes first. Always.
- **Vague Before states.** "Things are hard" — no. Specific daily reality.
- **Fantastical After states.** The After should feel achievable, not like a fairy tale.
- **Skipping Before.** Going straight to After loses the contrast that makes it powerful.
- **Bridge as feature list.** The Bridge is about getting from A to B, not listing everything the product does.
- **Unbalanced Before/After.** These should feel like equal weight. If Before is 3 paragraphs, After should be substantial too.

# Channel: Cold Outreach

**Format:** Short, personalized email or message seeking a response

**Typical length:** 50–150 words

**Use for:** Sales prospecting, partnership requests, investor outreach, guest post pitches, podcast booking, any situation where you're reaching out to someone who doesn't know you

---

## Audience Temperature

**Cold. Ice cold.**

The reader:
- Didn't ask to hear from you
- Gets dozens of these daily
- Will decide in 2–3 seconds whether to keep reading
- Is looking for a reason to delete
- Owes you nothing

Your job: earn 30 seconds of attention, then ask for one small thing.

---

## Reading Behavior

**Scan and delete.**

- Subject line determines open (along with sender name)
- First sentence determines whether they read sentence two
- Most readers skim — they don't read word by word
- Decision to respond happens fast
- Anything that feels like a template gets trashed

**Implications:**
- No throat-clearing. Start with relevance.
- Personalization must be real, not "I loved your recent post"
- One ask. Not two. Not "a quick call or if not maybe just feedback"
- Short paragraphs. White space. Easy to scan.

---

## Format Constraints

### Length
- **Subject line:** 3–8 words. Specific beats clever.
- **Body:** 50–150 words. Shorter is usually better.
- **Paragraphs:** 1–2 sentences each. Never a wall of text.

### Structure
1. **Opening line:** Why you're reaching out to *them specifically*
2. **Context:** Who you are (1 sentence max) + relevance
3. **Value or insight:** What's in it for them, or proof you're worth talking to
4. **Ask:** One clear, low-friction request
5. **Sign-off:** Name, minimal signature

### What NOT to include
- Your company's history
- Feature lists
- Multiple CTAs
- Calendly links in first email (presumptuous)
- "I know you're busy but..."
- Long signatures with quotes and social links

---

## Proof Types That Work

**Minimal proof, maximum specificity.**

- One specific result: "helped [similar company] do [specific thing]"
- Mutual connection: "Sarah Chen suggested I reach out"
- Relevant credential: "I wrote the [thing they'd recognize]"
- Observation that shows you did homework: reference something specific they said/built/wrote

**What doesn't work:**
- Client logos (feels like marketing)
- Testimonial blocks
- "We've helped 500+ companies" (vague, template-y)

---

## CTA Rules

**One ask. Low friction.**

**Good asks:**
- "Worth a conversation?"
- "Open to a 15-minute call next week?"
- "Would you be the right person to talk to about this?"
- "Interested?"
- "Mind if I send over a quick example?"

**Bad asks:**
- "Let me know when you're free for a 30-minute demo"
- "Check out our website and let me know your thoughts"
- "Would love to get 30 minutes to walk you through our platform and discuss potential synergies"
- Multiple asks in one email

**Placement:** End of email. After you've earned it.

---

## Subject Line Rules

**Specific beats clever. Short beats long.**

**Good subject lines:**
- "Quick question about [their company]"
- "[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out"
- "Idea for [specific thing they're working on]"
- "[Their company] + [your company]"
- "Saw your talk at [event]"

**Bad subject lines:**
- "Partnership opportunity"
- "Quick question"
- "Touching base"
- "Introduction"
- "Can I pick your brain?"
- Anything with "synergy," "revolutionize," or emojis

## Core Promise Inheritance

The framework's core promise compresses into: why should they care?

- **PAS:** Lead with a problem they have (that you noticed)
- **BAB:** Lead with where they could be vs. where they are
- **AIDA:** Lead with a hook that earns attention
- **FAB:** Lead with a specific outcome you can deliver
- **4Ps:** Lead with a bold, specific claim
- **ACCA:** Lead with an insight they haven't considered

---

## Framework Beat Compression

Cold outreach compresses the entire framework into 3–5 sentences.

### PAS (Feel the Pain)
1. Name a specific problem you noticed they have
2. Brief agitation (optional — often implied)
3. You can help. Here's one proof point.
4. Ask.

### BAB (Transformation)
1. Observation about their current state
2. What "after" could look like
3. You're the bridge. One credential.
4. Ask.

### AIDA (Build Urgency)
1. Hook that earns attention
2. Why it matters to them specifically
3. Desire: what they'd get
4. Ask.

### FAB (Lead with Value)
1. Specific outcome you can deliver
2. How (one sentence)
3. Proof point
4. Ask.

### 4Ps (Dream Then Prove)
1. Bold claim relevant to them
2. One proof point
3. Ask.

### ACCA (Educate Then Sell)
1. Insight or observation they haven't considered
2. Brief explanation of why it matters
3. You can help them act on it
4. Ask.

## Personalization Requirements

**Real personalization or don't bother.**

The reader can tell the difference between:
- "I saw you're in the marketing space" (template)
- "Your thread about attribution modeling last week nailed something most people miss" (real)

**Personalization that works:**
- Reference specific content they created
- Mention a specific challenge their company/role faces
- Note something from a talk, podcast, or interview
- Cite a mutual connection with context
- Comment on a recent company announcement with a real observation

**Personalization that doesn't work:**
- "I love what you're doing at [company]"
- "Your profile is impressive"
- "I noticed you're a [job title]"
- Anything that could apply to 100 other people

---

## Output Template

```
**Subject:** [3-8 words, specific to recipient]

[Opening: Why them specifically — 1 sentence]

[Context: Who you are + relevance — 1-2 sentences]

[Value/proof: What's in it for them or why you're credible — 1-2 sentences]

[Ask: One clear, low-friction request]

[Name]
```

---

## Example Output

**Subject:** Your SEO content engine

Hey Sarah,

Saw your post about building a content engine at Lattice — the part about programmatic SEO without sacrificing quality is exactly the problem we've been solving.

I run content at Clearscope. We just helped Ramp scale from 50 to 400 indexed pages while keeping their quality bar. Similar motion to what you're describing.

Worth comparing notes? 15 minutes, no pitch.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **The novel.** If it's more than 150 words, you've lost.
- **The template.** If it could go to anyone, it'll resonate with no one.
- **The humble brag.** "We've been featured in Forbes, TechCrunch, and..." — nobody cares.
- **The multiple ask.** One CTA. That's it.
- **The calendar link.** Don't send your Calendly in email one. Earn the right first.
- **The follow-up threat.** "I'll follow up next week if I don't hear back" — presumptuous.
- **The apology opener.** "Sorry to bother you" — starts weak.
- **The buzzword soup.** "Synergize," "leverage," "circle back" — instant delete.

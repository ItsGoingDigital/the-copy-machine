# Framework: Dream Then Prove (4Ps)

**Structure:** Promise → Picture → Proof → Push

**Use when:** You want to lead with aspiration but earn trust through evidence. The reader is skeptical but dreams big. They've heard bold claims before — they need you to back yours up.

---

## Awareness Level

**Skeptical but aspirational.** The reader wants to believe. They're drawn to big promises. But they've been burned before — by hype that didn't deliver, by products that overpromised. Your job: make the promise, make it vivid, then prove it's real before you ask for anything.

---

## Required Beats

### Beat 1: Promise

**Purpose:** A bold claim. What the product delivers, stated with confidence.

**Rules:**
- Lead with the promise, not the product.
- Confident, specific, and testable. Not vague aspiration.
- The promise should be something only this product can claim (or claim most credibly).
- Don't hedge. If you believe in the product, state what it does.
- This is the flag you plant — everything else supports it.

**Good example:** "Landing page copy that converts — written in 60 seconds, not 6 hours."

**Good example:** "The same copywriting frameworks agencies charge $5,000 to apply — delivered instantly."

**Bad example:** "We help you improve your marketing results."

**Bad example:** "The best AI writing tool on the market." (too generic, not specific promise)

**Length:** 1-2 sentences for the core promise. Can expand to 1 short paragraph.

### Beat 2: Picture

**Purpose:** Visualize that promise lived out. Paint the scene.

**Rules:**
- What does the reader's life/work/day look like with this?
- Make the promise tangible through specifics.
- This is the "imagine" section — aspirational but grounded.
- Should feel like a trailer for their better future.
- Still not product mechanics — this is about the outcome visualized.

**Good example:** "Picture this: you paste your landing page into the tool, answer two questions, and sixty seconds later you have copy that sounds like you — but sharper. The headline makes visitors stop. The body copy builds momentum. The CTA feels natural. You publish it, and next week your conversion rate looks different."

**Emotional register:** This is the peak. Aspiration, visualization, identity.

**Length:** 1-3 paragraphs. Paint the scene fully.

### Beat 3: Proof

**Purpose:** Evidence that the promise is real. The dream is grounded.

**Rules:**
- Testimonials from people who got the promised result.
- Data that supports the claim.
- Mechanism explanation — how it actually delivers.
- Case studies or before/after examples.
- This is the load-bearing section. Without it, the Promise is empty.

**Good example:**
> "I was skeptical. Another AI tool? But the output was actually different — specific, not generic. My homepage conversion rate went from 2.1% to 3.4% in two weeks." — [Name]

**Good example:** "Built on the PAS, BAB, AIDA, FAB, and 4Ps frameworks that professional copywriters use. Not prompt engineering — actual copywriting methodology."

**Logical register:** This is where it lives. Numbers, mechanisms, external validation.

**Length:** 2-4 paragraphs or sections. This beat can't be rushed.

### Beat 4: Push

**Purpose:** The ask. Direct CTA with the promise restated.

**Rules:**
- Clear, direct call to action.
- Restate the promise or benefit in the CTA.
- Low friction — make the next step obvious and easy.
- Confident ask — you've proven your case.

**Good example:** "Try The Copy Machine free. See what your landing page looks like rewritten by actual copywriting frameworks — in 60 seconds."

**Bad example:** "Get started" (doesn't restate promise)

**Bad example:** "Learn more about our features" (wrong energy after building desire)

**Length:** 1-2 sentences + CTA.

## Transition Rules

### Promise → Picture

**Transition type:** Imagination / "Imagine"

**Phrases that work:**
- "Imagine:"
- "Picture this:"
- "Here's what that looks like:"
- "Let me show you what I mean:"

**Mechanism:** You made a bold claim. Now make it vivid.

### Picture → Proof

**Transition type:** Grounding / "And this isn't hypothetical"

**Phrases that work:**
- "And this isn't hypothetical."
- "Sound too good? Here's the proof."
- "Don't take our word for it:"
- "Here's how we know it works:"

**Mechanism:** The dream is compelling. Now ground it in reality before skepticism kicks in.

### Proof → Push

**Transition type:** Momentum / "So"

**Phrases that work:**
- "So:"
- "Ready?"
- "Your move:"
- "Try it yourself:"

**Mechanism:** Proof delivered. Skepticism handled. Time for action.

## Section Count

**4 sections total.**

This is a balanced framework. Each beat gets its section.

**Core structure:**
1. Promise (hero)
2. Picture (visualization section)
3. Proof (evidence section — this is load-bearing)
4. Push (CTA section)

**Critical note:** The Proof beat cannot be thin. If Proof is a single weak testimonial, the entire framework collapses. Promise without Proof is just hype — and the reader knows it.

**Can include within Proof:**
- Multiple testimonials
- Data/stats
- Mechanism explanation
- Before/after
- Case study summary

## Channel Compression Guide

### Landing Page
Full 4-beat structure. Promise = hero headline + subhead. Picture = section 2. Proof = sections 3-4 (can be multiple proof sections). Push = final section with CTA repeated.

### Email
Promise = subject line + first sentence. Picture = paragraph 2. Proof = quick social proof or stat (1 paragraph). Push = CTA.

### Social
Promise = hook line. Picture = 1 sentence visualization. Proof = mentioned but can't fully deliver (link to landing page for full proof). Push = CTA.

### Ad Copy
Promise = headline. Picture = optional in description. Proof = one specific claim or number. Push = CTA.

### Sales Page
All beats expanded significantly. Promise can be multi-angle. Picture gets full visualization section. Proof becomes 3-4 sections (testimonials, case studies, mechanism, data). Push repeated throughout + final section with guarantee.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Weak Promise.** Generic promises don't earn attention. Specific, bold, testable.
- **Picture without specifics.** "Imagine things being better" — no. Specific visualization.
- **Thin Proof.** One vague testimonial does not support a bold promise. Stack proof.
- **Proof before Picture.** The sequence matters. Dream first, then ground.
- **Push without confidence.** You earned this. Don't go soft on the CTA.
- **Promise you can't back up.** Everything in Promise must be provable in Proof. Don't overreach.

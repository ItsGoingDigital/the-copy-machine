# Framework: Feel the Pain (PAS)

**Structure:** Problem → Agitate → Solution

**Use when:** The reader knows something's wrong but hasn't found the fix yet. They're living with friction, frustration, or a workaround that's costing them.

---

## Awareness Level

**Problem-aware.** The reader recognizes the problem exists. They've felt it. They may have tried other solutions that didn't work. They don't need convincing that a problem exists — they need to see that you understand it deeply and have the answer.

---

## Required Beats

### Beat 1: Problem

**Purpose:** Name something broken in the reader's world.

**Rules:**
- Be specific. Not "you have a problem" but the exact frustration they recognize.
- Use language they'd use themselves. Mirror how they describe it internally.
- The product does NOT appear here. This beat is entirely about the reader.
- Make them feel seen. The goal is recognition: "That's exactly what I'm dealing with."

**Good example:** "You've rewritten that landing page headline four times. Each version sounds like every other SaaS site. You know it's generic. You just don't know how to fix it."

**Bad example:** "Many businesses struggle with their marketing copy."

**Length:** 1-3 paragraphs depending on channel.

### Beat 2: Agitate

**Purpose:** Show what happens if they don't fix it. Make the status quo feel unacceptable.

**Rules:**
- The cost of inaction. What do they lose by continuing as-is?
- Escalate the stakes honestly. No manufactured fear, no manipulation — real consequences.
- Future-pace the negative: where does this lead in 3 months, 6 months?
- Still no product. This beat extends the problem, doesn't solve it yet.

**Good example:** "Every week that page stays live, it converts the same mediocre 2%. That's hundreds of visitors who bounce — people who needed what you built but couldn't tell from your words. Your competitor with worse product but better copy? They're getting those customers."

**Bad example:** "This problem will only get worse! Don't wait — act now!"

**Emotional register:** This is where it lives. Pain, frustration, the weight of the problem.

**Length:** 1-2 paragraphs. Don't belabor — agitate, then move.

### Beat 3: Solution

**Purpose:** Introduce the product as relief. The tension from Agitate resolves here.

**Rules:**
- The product enters now — positioned as the answer to everything you just described.
- Direct connection: "That's why we built [product]" or "Here's the fix."
- Explain what it does and how it solves the specific problems named above.
- Include the mechanism — how does it actually work?
- Transition to proof or CTA depending on channel.

**Good example:** "That's why we built CopyFix. Two questions, thirty seconds, and it rewrites your headline with the specificity that generic AI can't touch. It's not random — it's built on the frameworks actual copywriters use."

**Logical register:** This is where it lives. Mechanism, specifics, how it works.

**Length:** 2-4 paragraphs depending on channel. Can expand into sub-sections on longer formats.

## Transition Rules

### Problem → Agitate

**Transition type:** Escalation

**Phrases that work:**
- "And it gets worse."
- "Here's the thing nobody talks about:"
- "That's just the obvious part. The real cost is..."
- "But that's not even the worst of it."

**Mechanism:** Take the problem they nodded along to and show them the second-order effects they haven't fully confronted.

### Agitate → Solution

**Transition type:** Relief

**Phrases that work:**
- "Here's the way out."
- "There's a fix."
- "That's why we built..."
- "You don't have to keep doing it this way."
- "What if you could..."

**Mechanism:** The reader is now uncomfortable with the status quo. Offer the exit.

---

## Section Count

**3-4 sections total.**

This is a tight framework. It doesn't need:
- Long feature lists
- Multiple testimonial sections
- "About us" sections
- Team bios

**What it can include (if channel allows):**
- One testimonial that reinforces either the Agitate (someone who lived the pain) or the Solution (someone who found relief)
- Brief proof points in the Solution section
- FAQ only if objections are blocking purchase

**Cut anything that doesn't serve Problem, Agitate, or Solution.**

## Channel Compression Guide

### Landing Page
All three beats get full sections. Hero = Problem. Section 2 = Agitate. Section 3+ = Solution with proof.

### Email
Problem = first 1-2 paragraphs. Agitate = 1 paragraph. Solution = final paragraphs + CTA.

### Social
Problem only — or Problem + hint of Solution. No room for Agitate. Hook must be the Problem stated memorably.

### Ad Copy
Headline = Problem (stated as question or recognition). Description = Solution + CTA.

### Sales Page
All beats expanded. Problem can include multiple angles. Agitate can include case study of what happens without solution. Solution expands to features, proof, FAQ, guarantee.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Starting with the product.** The product never appears in Beat 1.
- **Generic problems.** "Businesses struggle with X" — no. Specific situations only.
- **Manufactured urgency.** The agitation must be real, not invented.
- **Skipping agitate.** Going straight from Problem to Solution loses emotional weight.
- **Over-agitating.** 1-2 paragraphs max. After that, you're just being cruel.
- **Solution without mechanism.** Don't just say "we fix this" — explain how.

# Framework: Lead with Value (FAB)

**Structure:** Outcome → Mechanism → Proof

**Use when:** The reader already knows they need something like this. They're comparing options. They want to know what they get and why yours is different. Lead with the value — no warm-up needed.

---

## Awareness Level

**Solution-aware.** The reader knows the category. They know products like this exist. They're evaluating: which one? Your job isn't to convince them they have a problem — it's to show them why your solution is the one.

---

## Required Beats

### Beat 1: Outcome

**Purpose:** Open with what the reader gets. The end result, stated plainly.

**Rules:**
- Lead with value, not features. What do they walk away with?
- Plain language. No hype, no buildup, no "before we get to that."
- Specific outcomes > vague benefits.
- This is the promise — make it clear.
- Product can be named here (unlike other frameworks) — but outcome comes before features.

**Good example:** "The Copy Machine gives you conversion-ready copy in under a minute. Pick a vibe, pick a goal, and get landing page copy that sounds like you hired a copywriter."

**Good example:** "Your landing page — rewritten with actual copywriting frameworks, not AI filler."

**Bad example:** "The Copy Machine is an innovative AI-powered tool that helps businesses improve their marketing."

**Length:** 1-2 paragraphs. Direct, confident, complete.

### Beat 2: Mechanism

**Purpose:** How it works. The explanation behind the outcome.

**Rules:**
- Explain the method, not just the result.
- Enough detail to be credible, not so much that it overwhelms.
- Answer the implicit question: "Okay, but how?"
- Differentiate here — what makes your approach different?
- Can include features, but always connected to why they matter.

**Good example:** "Here's how it works: you answer two questions — your brand's vibe and what you want your copy to do. The system combines a persuasion framework, a tone guide, and format constraints for your channel. Then it generates or rewrites, and runs every line through a quality filter that catches generic AI language before you ever see it."

**Logical register:** This is the core of this framework. Mechanism, specifics, how.

**Length:** 2-4 paragraphs. This is where you build credibility through specificity.

### Beat 3: Proof

**Purpose:** Evidence. Testimonials, data, demonstration.

**Rules:**
- Show, don't just claim.
- Testimonials that speak to results, not just satisfaction.
- Data if you have it — specific numbers.
- Before/after examples if applicable.
- The goal: remove doubt that the Outcome is real.

**Good example:**
> "I've tried every AI writing tool. They all sound the same. This is the first one that actually sounded like something I'd write — but better." — [Name], [Company]

**Good example:** "2,400+ landing pages rewritten. Average conversion lift: 34%."

**Length:** 1-3 sections depending on channel. More proof = more trust = higher ticket.

## Transition Rules

### Outcome → Mechanism

**Transition type:** "Here's how"

**Phrases that work:**
- "Here's how it works:"
- "The method behind it:"
- "Under the hood:"
- "What makes it different:"

**Mechanism:** You stated what they get. Now show them it's real by explaining how.

### Mechanism → Proof

**Transition type:** "Here's the evidence"

**Phrases that work:**
- "Don't take our word for it:"
- "Here's what that looks like in practice:"
- "The results speak for themselves:"
- "And here's the evidence:"

**Mechanism:** You explained how. Now prove it works with external validation.

---

## Section Count

**2-4 sections total.**

This is the most direct framework. It can be very tight.

**Core structure:**
1. Outcome (hero)
2. Mechanism (how it works)
3. Proof (testimonials/data)

**Risk with this framework:** It can feel dry. The tone file does heavy lifting here. Without the right voice, FAB becomes a feature spec.

**Does NOT need:**
- Problem setup (they already know the problem)
- Agitation (they're past that)
- Long visualization sections (they want facts)

## Channel Compression Guide

### Landing Page
Outcome = hero (headline + subhead + CTA). Mechanism = section 2. Proof = section 3. Can add features section between Mechanism and Proof if needed.

### Email
Outcome = first paragraph. Mechanism = brief middle paragraph. Proof = one strong quote or stat. CTA.

### Social
Outcome = entire post (this framework compresses to just the promise). Link to landing page for Mechanism and Proof.

### Ad Copy
Outcome = headline + description. No room for Mechanism or Proof — the ad is pure promise. Landing page delivers the rest.

### Sales Page
All beats expanded. Outcome can be multi-angle. Mechanism can be full "how it works" walkthrough. Proof expands to multiple testimonials, case studies, data sections, FAQ that handles objections.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Burying the value.** Don't build up to the outcome. Start with it.
- **Features without benefits.** "AI-powered" means nothing. "Rewrites in 30 seconds" means something.
- **Vague outcomes.** "Better copy" is not an outcome. "Copy that converts 40% better" is.
- **Mechanism without differentiation.** If your "how it works" could describe any competitor, it's not doing its job.
- **Proof without specifics.** "Customers love it" is not proof. Names, numbers, results.
- **Dry delivery.** This framework needs a strong tone to avoid feeling like a spec sheet.

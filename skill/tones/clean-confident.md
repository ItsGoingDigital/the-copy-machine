# Tone: Clean and Confident

**Voice model:** Apple

**Use when:** Sophisticated markets. Premium products. Readers who have heard every claim and respond to understatement. When you want credibility through restraint.

---

## Sentence Structure

- Short sentences. Declarative.
- Fragments used intentionally for emphasis.
- One idea per sentence. No compound sentences stacking multiple thoughts.
- Rhythm: short, short, medium. Never three long sentences in a row.
- Let silence (white space) do work.

**Good:**
> This is copy that works.
> You'll notice the difference.

**Bad:**
> This is copy that works really well and you'll definitely notice the difference when you try it because it's been designed with quality in mind.

---

## Vocabulary

- Simple but precise. Every word chosen, none wasted.
- No jargon. No slang. No filler.
- Trusts the reader to understand without hand-holding.
- Prefers concrete nouns over abstract concepts.
- Active voice. Always.

**Good:** "Your landing page. Rewritten. Done."

**Bad:** "Your landing page will be comprehensively rewritten utilizing our advanced methodology."

---

## Punctuation

- Periods do the heavy lifting.
- No exclamation marks. Ever. Confidence doesn't shout.
- Minimal commas. If a sentence needs multiple commas, it's too long.
- Em dashes rarely — and only for intentional pause.
- No ellipses.

---

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these)

1. **Never hedge.** No "we think," "we believe," "it might," "potentially." Either state it or don't.

2. **Never use humor.** This voice is serious. Not humorless — but not going for laughs.

3. **Never explain what should be obvious.** Trust the reader. Don't over-clarify.

4. **Never use more words than necessary.** If you can cut a word without losing meaning, cut it.

5. **Never use superlatives.** No "best," "most," "extremely," "incredibly." Let the product speak.

6. **Never be casual.** No contractions in formal statements. "It is" not "it's" when making a point.

7. **Never qualify claims.** "One of the best" — no. Either it is or don't say it.

## Market Fit

- Sophisticated markets where hype is a red flag
- Premium products where price signals quality
- Readers who have heard every marketing claim
- Products competing on quality, not price
- B2B with senior decision-makers
- Design, technology, and creative tools

---

## Cleverness Cap

If a stylistic choice doesn't advance understanding or desire, cut it. This voice achieves style through restraint, not flourish. Clever wordplay is out. Elegant simplicity is in.

## Example Lines

**Hero headline:**
> Copy that converts. Nothing more.

**Subheadline:**
> Your words, refined. Two questions. One rewrite.

**Body copy:**
> The Copy Machine applies professional copywriting frameworks to your landing page. No jargon. No learning curve. You answer two questions. You get copy that works.

**CTA:**
> Rewrite your page

**Proof section:**
> 2,400 pages rewritten. 34% average conversion lift. Specific results from specific frameworks.

## Applying This Tone

When writing in this voice:

1. Write the first draft
2. Cut every unnecessary word
3. Break long sentences into short ones
4. Remove all hedging language
5. Remove all exclamation marks
6. Remove all superlatives
7. Read it aloud — if it sounds like marketing, revise
8. Check: does every sentence earn its place?

The goal: the reader trusts you because you didn't try to impress them.

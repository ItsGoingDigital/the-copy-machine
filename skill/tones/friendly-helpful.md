# Tone: Friendly and Helpful

**Voice model:** Mailchimp

**Use when:** Products that need to feel approachable and human. SaaS, tools, apps where the user might feel intimidated or overwhelmed. When you want to be warm without being saccharine, and helpful without being condescending.

---

## Sentence Structure

- Conversational but clear. Not overly casual, not stiff.
- Mix of short and medium sentences. Rarely long.
- Direct when giving instructions. Warm when acknowledging feelings.
- Uses "you" naturally. Occasionally "we" to create partnership.

**Good:**
> You're all set. Your first campaign is ready to send — we'll let you know how it performs.

**Bad:**
> Your campaign has been successfully configured and is now queued for delivery. Performance metrics will be provided upon completion.

---

## Vocabulary

- Plain language. No jargon unless your audience uses it daily.
- Words that feel human: "got it," "sounds good," "here's the deal."
- Specific but not technical. Explains without dumbing down.
- Positive but not over-the-top. Encouraging without cheerleading.

**Good:** "Something went wrong on our end. We're looking into it — try again in a few minutes."

**Bad:** "An unexpected error has occurred. Please retry your request at a later time."

**Also bad:** "Oopsie! Something broke! Don't worry, we're ON IT! 🎉"

---

## Punctuation

- Standard punctuation. Periods, commas, the occasional dash.
- Exclamation marks are rare and earned. One per page maximum.
- No ALL CAPS for emphasis. Use word choice instead.
- Contractions always: "you're," "we'll," "it's," "don't."

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these)

1. **Never be condescending.** "It's easy!" implies the user is stupid if they struggle. Just show them how.

2. **Never use corporate speak.** "Leverage," "utilize," "facilitate" — these words create distance.

3. **Never fake enthusiasm.** Exclamation marks don't make boring things exciting. If it's not exciting, don't pretend.

4. **Never be vague to sound friendly.** Clarity is kindness. "Something went wrong" is friendly. "Uh oh!" with no explanation is frustrating.

5. **Never talk down.** Assume intelligence. Explain context, not obvious things.

6. **Never be robotic.** "Your request has been processed" can be "Done. You're all set."

7. **Never over-apologize.** One "sorry" is enough. Repeated apologies feel insincere.

## Market Fit

- SaaS and software products
- Products with learning curves
- Tools where users might feel overwhelmed
- B2B that wants to feel human
- Consumer apps that aren't trying to be edgy
- Any product where trust and approachability matter

## Cleverness Cap

Friendly doesn't mean funny. Humor is used sparingly and only when it reduces stress or builds connection. A joke that confuses is worse than no joke.

The goal is: the user feels helped, not entertained.

## Example Lines

**Hero headline:**
> Write copy that sounds like you — in about a minute.

**Subheadline:**
> The Copy Machine applies professional copywriting frameworks to your landing page. You answer two questions, it does the rest.

**Body copy:**
> You know that thing where you stare at your landing page and the words just... aren't right? We built this for that.
>
> Pick a vibe. Tell us what you want your copy to do. We'll rewrite it using the same frameworks professional copywriters use — without the jargon or the $5,000 invoice.

**Error message:**
> That didn't work. Check your connection and try again — if it keeps happening, let us know.

**Success message:**
> Done. Your new copy is ready.

**CTA:**
> Try it free

## Applying This Tone

When writing in this voice:

1. Write like you're explaining to a smart friend who's new to this
2. Read it aloud — does it sound like a person?
3. Cut any word that exists only to sound professional
4. Check: would this make sense to someone slightly stressed or distracted?
5. Remove fake enthusiasm (excessive exclamation marks, "awesome!", "wow!")
6. Add warmth through specificity, not adjectives
7. If explaining something complex, break it into steps

The goal: the reader feels like they're in good hands.

# Tone: Playful and Human

**Voice model:** Innocent Drinks

**Use when:** Consumer products that want to feel approachable and charming. When you want personality without edge, warmth without corporate earnestness. Products that don't take themselves too seriously but still deliver.

---

## Sentence Structure

- Short, conversational sentences. Like chatting.
- Occasional sentence fragments for rhythm. Like this one.
- Questions to the reader. Rhetorical but engaging.
- Simple structures. Subject-verb-object. No nested clauses.

**Good:**
> We made this. It's got fruit in it. Real fruit. From trees and bushes and things.

**Bad:**
> Our product has been carefully formulated with premium fruit ingredients sourced from quality suppliers.

---

## Vocabulary

- Simple, everyday words. "Made" not "crafted." "Good" not "exceptional."
- Slightly childlike without being childish. Wonder, not naivety.
- Self-effacing. "We tried our best." "It's not perfect, but we like it."
- Specific in unexpected ways. Details that make you smile.

**Good:** "We put the good stuff in and left the bad stuff out. Mostly because we couldn't figure out how to put the bad stuff in anyway."

**Bad:** "Our commitment to quality means we use only the finest ingredients."

---

## Punctuation

- Periods for pacing. Short sentences. Then another one.
- Ellipses occasionally... for trailing thoughts.
- Parentheses for asides (like little secrets between you and the reader).
- Light on exclamation marks. The playfulness comes from word choice, not punctuation.

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these)

1. **Never be snarky.** Playful is warm. Snarky is cold. There's no eye-rolling here.

2. **Never punch down.** The humor is self-directed or observational, never at the reader's expense.

3. **Never try too hard.** If a joke doesn't land naturally, cut it. Forced whimsy is worse than none.

4. **Never be random.** Playful isn't "holds up spork" random. Every line has purpose.

5. **Never lose clarity.** If the playfulness obscures what you're selling, dial it back.

6. **Never be ironic.** This voice is sincere. The humor comes from honesty and observation, not detachment.

7. **Never use corporate language.** "Stakeholders," "leverage," "synergy" — these words kill the voice instantly.

## Market Fit

- Consumer products (food, beverage, household)
- Products for creative people
- Brands that want to feel small even if they're not
- Products competing against stuffy incumbents
- Anything where charm is a differentiator
- Kids' products (but also works for adults)

## Cleverness Cap

The playfulness serves connection, not showing off. Every charming line should make the reader like you more, not admire your copywriter.

If you're laughing at your own joke, cut it.

## Example Lines

**Hero headline:**
> Copy that doesn't sound like a robot wrote it. (A robot did help, but we supervised.)

**Subheadline:**
> Two questions. A few seconds. Words that actually sound like you.

**Body copy:**
> Here's the thing. Writing is hard. Writing about yourself is harder. Writing about yourself in a way that makes people want to give you money? Nearly impossible.
>
> So we made a thing that helps. You tell it what vibe you're going for. You tell it what you want your words to do. It does the rest.
>
> Is it magic? No. It's frameworks. The same ones real copywriters use. We just made them easier to get to.

**About section:**
> We're a small team who got tired of reading the same landing pages over and over. "Revolutionize your workflow." "Seamlessly integrate." You know the ones.
>
> So we built something to fix that. It's not perfect, but we're quite pleased with it.

**Error message:**
> Well, that didn't work. We're not sure why. Maybe try again? (We're looking into it.)

**CTA:**
> Give it a go

## Applying This Tone

When writing in this voice:

1. Write a straightforward version first
2. Find one or two places to add personality (not every sentence)
3. Read aloud — does it sound like a real person you'd want to talk to?
4. Cut anything that feels like "look how clever we are"
5. Check: is it still clear what you're selling?
6. Add small, specific details that surprise
7. Make sure the warmth is genuine, not performed

The goal: the reader smiles and feels like they're dealing with actual humans.

# Tone: Technical and Precise

**Voice model:** Stripe

**Use when:** Developer tools, APIs, B2B software, technical products. When your audience is smart, hates fluff, and respects precision. When credibility comes from knowing your stuff, not from enthusiasm.

---

## Sentence Structure

- Clear, direct sentences. No wasted words.
- Technical terms used correctly. No "dumbing down."
- Parallel structure for lists and comparisons.
- Complex ideas broken into digestible pieces, but never oversimplified.

**Good:**
> The Copy Machine applies copywriting frameworks to your existing content. Select a framework and tone, provide your copy, and receive a structured rewrite in seconds.

**Bad:**
> We've built an amazing tool that totally transforms your copy using super smart AI and proven frameworks that real copywriters use!

---

## Vocabulary

- Precise technical language. Say exactly what you mean.
- Industry terms where appropriate — your audience knows them.
- No buzzwords. "Fast" not "blazing fast." "Simple" not "dead simple."
- Specific numbers and details. Vague claims undermine credibility.

**Good:** "Rewrites process in under 3 seconds. Framework selection supports 6 structures including PAS, AIDA, and BAB."

**Bad:** "Lightning-fast processing with cutting-edge frameworks."

---

## Punctuation

- Standard punctuation. Correct and unremarkable.
- No exclamation marks. Confidence doesn't shout.
- Code formatting where relevant: `framework`, `tone`, `channel`.
- Em dashes for clarification — like this — used sparingly.

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these)

1. **Never use marketing superlatives.** "Revolutionary," "game-changing," "best-in-class" — these words signal you have nothing real to say.

2. **Never be vague.** "Improved performance" means nothing. "34% faster response times" means something.

3. **Never condescend.** Don't explain things your audience already knows. Assume competence.

4. **Never hide information.** Technical audiences want details. Provide them.

5. **Never use filler phrases.** "In order to," "it is important to note that," "at the end of the day" — cut all of these.

6. **Never fake enthusiasm.** Your audience can tell. Respect earns more than excitement.

7. **Never sacrifice accuracy for style.** If the precise word is jargon, use the jargon.

## Market Fit

- Developer tools and APIs
- B2B SaaS for technical users
- Infrastructure and platform products
- Products where the buyer is the user (not a manager buying for a team)
- Documentation-heavy products
- Any product where your audience has low tolerance for marketing speak

## Cleverness Cap

Wit is acceptable if it's subtle and doesn't slow comprehension. A slightly dry observation is fine. A pun is not.

The reader should finish the page informed, not impressed by your wordplay.

## Example Lines

**Hero headline:**
> Copywriting frameworks, applied automatically.

**Subheadline:**
> The Copy Machine rewrites landing pages using structured persuasion frameworks. Two inputs, one output, no prompt engineering required.

**Body copy:**
> Most AI-generated copy fails because it lacks structure. The Copy Machine solves this by separating content into three layers: framework (persuasion structure), tone (voice and style), and channel (format constraints).
>
> You select a framework — PAS, AIDA, BAB, FAB, 4Ps, or ACCA. You select a tone that matches your brand. The system combines these with channel-specific rules and rewrites your copy accordingly.
>
> The output follows the framework's required beats, respects the tone's constraints, and fits the channel's format. No prompt crafting. No iteration.

**How it works:**
> 1. Provide existing copy or describe your product
> 2. Select framework (what the copy should do)
> 3. Select tone (how it should sound)
> 4. Receive structured output

**Specs section:**
> - **Frameworks:** PAS, BAB, AIDA, FAB, 4Ps, ACCA
> - **Tones:** 8 distinct voice profiles
> - **Channels:** Landing page, email, social, ad copy, sales page
> - **Processing:** Under 3 seconds
> - **Output:** Markdown with section structure preserved

## Applying This Tone

When writing in this voice:

1. State what the thing does, plainly
2. Provide specifics: numbers, names, technical details
3. Cut every word that doesn't add information
4. Check: would a developer roll their eyes at this? If yes, revise.
5. Use formatting (bullets, code, tables) to increase scannability
6. Assume your reader is smart and busy
7. Let the product speak — don't oversell

The goal: the reader understands exactly what this does and trusts that you know what you're talking about.

# Tone: Raw and Motivational

**Voice model:** Nike

**Use when:** Products tied to ambition, effort, personal growth. Markets that respect directness. When you want to challenge the reader and make them feel capable of more.

---

## Sentence Structure

- Short punchy sentences for impact.
- Then one longer one that builds momentum.
- Imperative mood. Commands. "Do this." "Stop that." "Make it happen."
- Repetition as rhetorical device — same structure, different content.
- Rhythm: punch, punch, build. Then punch again.

**Good:**
> You didn't build this to blend in.
> Stop letting your copy hold you back.
> Ship it. Fix the words. Ship it again.

**Bad:**
> Perhaps you might consider the possibility that your copywriting could potentially be improved if you were to utilize a tool designed for that purpose.

---

## Vocabulary

- Second person: "you," "your." Direct address.
- Visceral, physical language. Words you feel in your body.
- "Build." "Ship." "Grind." "Push." "Fight." "Earn."
- Active verbs over passive descriptions.
- No softeners: "maybe," "perhaps," "a bit," "sort of."

**Good:** "You're here because good enough stopped being enough."

**Bad:** "Many entrepreneurs find themselves wanting to improve their marketing materials."

---

## Punctuation

- Periods for punch. Full stop. Impact.
- Occasional fragments for rhythm.
- Repetition is a tool, not an accident.
- Questions to challenge: "You ready?" "What's stopping you?"
- No semicolons. No parenthetical asides. Direct.

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these)

1. **Never preach.** Challenging is not lecturing. You're beside them, not above them.

2. **Never condescend.** Respect the reader. They're doing hard things. Acknowledge that.

3. **Never use corporate language.** "Leverage," "optimize," "synergy" — these words are dead here.

4. **Never use passive voice.** "Mistakes were made" — no. "You made a mistake. Now fix it."

5. **Never soften the message.** If it's true, say it directly. No cushioning.

6. **Never be abstract.** Concrete actions, concrete outcomes. Not vague inspiration.

7. **Never be cynical.** This voice believes in effort. It's not ironic or detached.

## Market Fit

- Products for ambitious people
- Creator tools and indie products
- Fitness, productivity, skill-building
- B2C with driven customers
- Markets where "hustle" is not a dirty word
- Products that help people level up

---

## Cleverness Cap

Clever wordplay is out. Direct language is in. If a phrase sounds like it belongs on a poster, it might work — but only if it's specific to what you're selling. Generic motivation ("Believe in yourself!") fails. Specific challenge ("Your copy is costing you customers. Fix it.") works.

## Example Lines

**Hero headline:**
> Good enough got you here. Better gets you paid.

**Subheadline:**
> Your landing page is holding you back. Stop tolerating it.

**Body copy:**
> You've built something real. You've shipped. You've iterated.
>
> But your copy? It sounds like everyone else's. The same AI-generated phrases. The same "revolutionize your workflow" nonsense.
>
> That stops now.
>
> Two questions. Thirty seconds. Copy that sounds like a founder who gives a damn — because you are.

**CTA:**
> Fix your copy

**Proof section:**
> 2,400 founders have used this. Average conversion lift: 34%. Because good words beat clever words.

## Applying This Tone

When writing in this voice:

1. Write the first draft
2. Replace passive voice with active
3. Convert long sentences into punchy short ones
4. Add second-person address: "you," "your"
5. Cut softening language: "maybe," "might," "a little"
6. Read aloud — does it sound like a coach, not a lecturer?
7. Check: is this challenging or condescending? (It should challenge.)
8. Verify: is there physical, visceral language?

The goal: the reader feels capable and challenged, not scolded or inspired with empty words.

# Tone: Warm and Mission-Driven

**Voice model:** Patagonia

**Use when:** Products with genuine purpose. Audiences who distrust hard sells. Markets where trust matters more than excitement. When authenticity is your competitive advantage.

---

## Sentence Structure

- Longer sentences with natural rhythm. Flowing, not choppy.
- "We" language — inclusive, communal. We're in this together.
- Compound sentences that build on each other.
- Rhythm: medium, medium, short. Occasional long sentences for depth.
- Conversational but thoughtful. Like a letter from a friend who cares.

**Good:**
> We built this because we kept seeing the same hollow words on every site we visited. Yours deserves better.

**Bad:**
> Our revolutionary platform was designed to optimize your marketing outcomes through innovative AI technology.

## Vocabulary

- Earnest. Real-world context. Grounded.
- Specifics over hype. What actually happens, not what it could mean.
- Words that feel genuine: "care," "honest," "real," "true."
- No corporate language. No marketing speak.
- First person plural: "we" — because you're part of a community.

**Good:** "Good copy isn't clever — it's honest. It says what you actually mean, clearly enough that someone believes you."

**Bad:** "Leverage our cutting-edge solution to revolutionize your brand's messaging."

## Punctuation

- Standard punctuation. Clean, not dramatic.
- No exclamation marks (urgency isn't the point).
- Em dashes for natural pauses in speech.
- The warmth comes from word choice, not formatting tricks.
- Question marks for genuine questions, not rhetorical devices.

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these)

1. **Never be performative.** The warmth must be genuine, not a tactic.

2. **Never virtue-signal.** Don't claim values you haven't earned. Show, don't tell.

3. **Never use urgency tactics.** No artificial scarcity. No "buy now or miss out."

4. **Never manipulate.** Hard sells, countdown timers, manufactured FOMO — all off-limits.

5. **Never be preachy.** Share your values, don't lecture about them.

6. **Never oversell.** Understated claims build trust. Hyperbole destroys it.

7. **Never fake authenticity.** If you can't be genuinely warm, pick a different tone.

- Mission-driven companies
- Products with genuine social or environmental purpose

- Community-oriented brands
- B2B with values-aligned buyers

## Cleverness Cap

Clever wordplay doesn't fit here. This voice achieves impact through sincerity, not wit. If something sounds like marketing, cut it. The goal is to sound like a person who believes in what they're building — because you are.

## Example Lines

**Hero headline:**
> Copy that sounds like it came from someone who cares.

**Subheadline:**
> We built this because we were tired of seeing the same empty phrases on every website. Including ours.

**Body copy:**
> Here's what we believe: your words should mean something.
>
> Not "revolutionize your workflow" — something real. Something specific to what you actually do and who you actually help.
>
> The Copy Machine is a small tool that does one thing well. It takes your landing page and rewrites it using the same frameworks professional copywriters use. Not prompt tricks. Not buzzword generators. Real structure that helps real people understand why you matter.
>
> It's not magic. It's just honest craft, made accessible.

**CTA:**
> Try it and see

**Proof section:**
> We've helped 2,400 people rewrite their pages. The average conversion lift is 34% — not because we're clever, but because clear, specific language builds trust. And trust converts.

## Applying This Tone

When writing in this voice:

1. Write the first draft
2. Replace "I" with "we" where appropriate
3. Cut all urgency language and artificial scarcity
4. Remove superlatives and hype words
5. Add specific, grounded details
6. Read aloud — does it sound like a person or a brand?
7. Check: would you trust this voice?
8. Verify: is the warmth genuine or performed?

The goal: the reader trusts you because you sound like someone who means what they say.

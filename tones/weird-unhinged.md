# Tone: Weird and Unhinged

**Voice model:** Liquid Death

**Use when:** Crowded markets where standing out matters more than credibility. Products competing against boring incumbents. When you want to be memorable, not forgettable.

## Sentence Structure

- Varies wildly. Intentionally unpredictable.
- Abrupt fragments next to flowing asides.
- Parentheticals. (Yes, like this.) Unexpected interruptions.
- Dashes — for sudden turns — and second thoughts.
- Break the fourth wall. Acknowledge you're writing marketing copy.

**Good:**
> Your landing page copy was written by the same AI that wrote everyone else's.
> Congrats on the conformity.
> (We're kidding. Kind of. Not really.)

**Bad:**
> Many businesses struggle with creating unique marketing copy that differentiates them from competitors in their industry.

## Vocabulary

- Casual. The way people actually talk.
- Unexpected analogies and comparisons.
- Self-deprecating but confident. "We know this is weird. It works."
- Breaks expectations. Zigs when readers expect zag.
- Profanity is possible but not required — only if it fits the brand.

**Good:** "Look, you're not going to learn copywriting at 11pm on a Tuesday. Just install the thing."

**Bad:** "Our innovative solution leverages advanced AI to transform your marketing outcomes."

## Punctuation

- Dashes for sudden shifts — wait, what were we saying?
- Ellipses for trailing off... or dramatic pause
- Parenthetical asides (because sometimes you need to talk to the reader directly)
- Casual punctuation that matches internal monologue
- Question marks that are rhetorical and sarcastic

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these)

1. **Humor must serve the sale.** If a joke obscures what the product does, cut it. Weird ≠ confusing.

2. **Never be random for random's sake.** The irreverence has a point. It's not chaos.

3. **Never be mean-spirited.** Punching down kills the vibe. Self-aware, not cruel.

4. **Never sacrifice clarity.** The reader should always understand what you're selling.

5. **Never be tryhard.** Forced weirdness is worse than boring. If a joke doesn't land, cut it.

6. **Never be generic weird.** "We're not like other brands!" is the most like-other-brands thing you can say.

7. **Never forget to sell.** This voice is fun, but it's still copy. The CTA still needs to convert.

## Market Fit

- Crowded markets with boring incumbents
- Products for younger, internet-native audiences
- Brands that can afford to alienate some people
- Products where personality is a differentiator
- Consumer products, creator tools, indie apps
- Not: B2B enterprise, healthcare, finance (usually)

## Cleverness Cap

Clever is allowed — but clever that obscures is not. Every weird choice should either:
1. Make the reader laugh while understanding the product better
2. Make the product memorable by breaking pattern

If a bit makes the copy confusing, cut it. The sale matters more than the joke.

## Example Lines

**Hero headline:**
> Your landing page sounds like it was generated by a corporate AI during a strategy meeting.
> (It probably was.)

**Subheadline:**
> We made a Claude Skill that fixes your words. Yes, that's AI fixing AI. We're aware of the irony.

**Body copy:**
> Here's the thing about AI-generated copy: it's all the same copy. "Revolutionize your workflow." "Seamlessly integrate." "Unlock your potential."
>
> Cool. So does everyone else's site.
>
> The Copy Machine is different. (Okay, it's also AI, but it's AI that was trained to hate the same buzzwords you hate.)
>
> Two questions. Thirty seconds. Copy that doesn't sound like 400,000 other landing pages.

**CTA:**
> Fix your boring copy

**Proof section:**
> 2,400 people have used this. Average conversion lift: 34%. (No, we didn't make that up. Yes, we're as surprised as you are.)

## Applying This Tone

When writing in this voice:

1. Write a straightforward draft first
2. Identify opportunities for unexpected turns
3. Add self-aware commentary where it fits
4. Break the fourth wall at least once
5. Insert a parenthetical aside
6. Read aloud — does it sound like a funny friend or a brand trying to be funny?
7. Check: is the product still clear?
8. Verify: does every joke serve the sale?

The goal: the reader is entertained AND understands exactly what you're selling. Never sacrifice clarity for comedy.

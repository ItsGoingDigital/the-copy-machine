# Tone: Witty and Self-Aware

**Voice model:** Oatly

**Use when:** Products competing against boring or corporate alternatives. Audiences who appreciate honesty over polish. When you want to be disarmingly honest about what you're selling.

---

## Sentence Structure

- Conversational. Mix of short and medium.
- Questions directed at the reader — rhetorical but engaging.
- Talks like a smart friend explaining something.
- Asides that comment on the copy itself.
- Rhythm: statement, question, observation. Varied.

**Good:**
> You know that copy Claude wrote for your landing page? The "revolutionize your workflow" one? Yeah, 400,000 other sites have that same sentence.

**Bad:**
> Many businesses struggle to differentiate their marketing copy from competitors.

---

## Vocabulary

- Self-aware about being marketing. Acknowledges what it is.
- Sometimes comments on its own copy: "Yes, this is still a landing page."
- Uses humor to lower defenses, then lands a real point.
- Conversational vocabulary — the way you'd actually explain this to someone.
- No corporate speak. No buzzwords. Those are the enemy.

**Good:** "This is a Claude Skill that makes your copy less... Claude-y. We'd apologize for the recursion but honestly it works."

**Bad:** "Our innovative AI solution leverages advanced language models to optimize your content strategy."

---

## Punctuation

- Dashes for asides — like this — where you add commentary.
- Rhetorical questions. (You know the kind.)
- Occasional fragments for timing.
- Quotation marks to call out clichés: "synergy," "revolutionize."
- Parentheses for (admittedly self-aware) commentary.

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these)

1. **Never sacrifice clarity for a punchline.** The joke is a vehicle, not the destination.

2. **Never punch down.** Self-deprecating is fine. Mocking the reader is not.

3. **Never be smug.** Self-aware is charming. Self-satisfied is repulsive.

4. **Never make the product feel unserious.** The humor builds trust, it doesn't undermine the product.

5. **Never overdo it.** Not every sentence needs a joke. Let some lines be straight.

6. **Never be mean.** Clever is good. Cruel is out.

7. **Never confuse.** If the self-awareness makes it unclear what you're selling, dial it back.

## Market Fit

- Products competing against corporate or stuffy alternatives
- Younger, internet-savvy audiences
- Brands that can poke fun at their own category
- Products where personality differentiates
- Consumer products, creator tools, indie apps
- Can work in B2B if the buyer appreciates directness

---

## Cleverness Cap

Wit serves the message, not the writer's ego. Every clever line should:
1. Make the reader like you more
2. Make the product easier to understand
3. Lower skepticism through honesty

If a line is clever but doesn't advance the sale, cut it.

## Example Lines

**Hero headline:**
> Two questions. Thirty seconds. Copy that doesn't sound like a committee wrote it.

**Subheadline:**
> You know how all AI copy sounds the same? (This page was written by AI too, but go ahead and keep reading.)

**Body copy:**
> Let's be honest: you didn't come here to learn copywriting. You came here because it's 11pm, your landing page sounds generic, and you're wondering if there's a faster way.
>
> There is.
>
> The Copy Machine asks you two questions — what vibe fits your brand, and what you want your copy to do. Then it rewrites your page using actual copywriting frameworks. Not the "revolutionize seamlessly leverage" kind. The kind that professional copywriters charge $5,000 to apply.
>
> Is it perfect? No. Is it better than what you have? Almost certainly.

**CTA:**
> Worth 30 seconds to find out

**Proof section:**
> 2,400 people have used this. Average conversion lift: 34%. (We didn't believe it either. Then we checked the data.)

## Applying This Tone

When writing in this voice:

1. Write a straightforward draft first
2. Identify opportunities to acknowledge what you're doing ("yes, this is marketing")
3. Add one or two rhetorical questions
4. Insert a self-aware aside or parenthetical
5. Call out clichés instead of using them
6. Read aloud — does it sound like a clever friend or a brand trying too hard?
7. Check: is the product still clear?
8. Verify: did the humor make you like the brand more?

The goal: the reader smiles, feels respected, and understands exactly what you're selling.
